// the creation of the object
// classname objectname=new classname();

// the methods in java which can be created without creating the object were called as the static functions or static methods

        // we sould call the main method wthour creating the object there fore we should add static to it
        // e.g public static void main()
        // here we should call the main method without creating the object;
        // jvm will call the main method as javafundamentals.main() 
        // we declare the main method as the public to make itself available to the jvm if we dont declare public it will not make available to the Java Virtual Machine

        // main methid should alwaya be written as the public static void main(String args[])
        // here public make available to the jvm
        // static to access the main without creating the object
        // void which represent that no value will be returned
        // main is the entry/starting point of the program

        // we can also write
        // static public void main(String args[])
        // static public void main(String x[])

    
    # naming conventions
        // to import the packeges 
        // all letters should be small e.g:- 
        // to name a method and variables firstword will be a small case and from second word onwards it was capital letter
        // naming of the variable will be the same as of the method naming

        // all the variable contains inbuilt constant values should be all uppercase
        // PI,BOLD etc
        // all keywords such as public,static,void,int,float,private etc should be all small case letters
